 <h2>Monitors</h2>

 -  <h3>LCD</h3> 
     - Liquid crystal display
     - Advantages
        - Lightweight
        - Low power requirement
        - inexpensive
     - Disavantages
        - Black levels are not good
        - Requires seperate backlight
        - Can be difficult to replace the light on screen
     - LCD tech
        - TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD
            - Fast response time which is good like gaming
            - but has poor viewing angles, if you're not sitting in the middle it starts to lose the color or get darkened
        - IPS (In Plane Switching) LCD
            - Excellent color representation
            - A bit more expensive to produce than the TN technology
        - VA (Vertical Alignment) LCD
            - Good compromise between TN and IPS
            - Good color representation
            - But at a cost of slower response time than TN
    

 -  <h3>OLED</h3> 
     - Organic compound that emits light when recieving an electric current
     - No backlight
     - Thinner and lighter
     - Very often used for flexible devices like tablets, phones and smartwatches
     - Very accurate color representation
     - Tends to be a higher cost than LCD 

 -  <h3>Mini LED</h3> 
     - A recent new innovation that was first introduced back in 2019 where they brought mini LED into the market, it was supose to be a competition price point between LCD and LED displays, hence mini LED was introduced.
        - Compared to the conventional LED the mini LED has much smaller backlight that can be enabled or disabled, so the color and intensity can be different
        - Much better control over dark screen areas, deeper blacks, better color representation

 -  <h3>Backlight and inverters</h3> 
     - LCD displays need a backlight
     - It uses either Florescent lamp or LED lights
        - LED lights get their power from DC (Direct current)
        - but if using a older laptop, it's high likely that they are using a Florescent lamp which requires a inverter that turn DC into AC power
    - To verify backlight you can look closely at the screen and use a flashlight
 
 <h2>Display attributes</h2>

 - Since not all diplays are created equal, there are various specifications, options and settings that has a advantage over another
    - Requirement can vary between...
        - Web browsing
        - Video and Photo editing
        - Information displays
        - Phones
