<h1>CLI (Command-line interface)</h1>

CLI is used to manage cisco devices such as switches, routers and firewalls. 
You connect to a Cisco device by plugging into the console port of the device via either usb or a RJ45
 - With a RJ45 you will use a rollover cable but it's possible that you might need a adapter for it into a usb
 - Rollover cable have 8 pins and they are connected 1-8, 2-7, 3-6, 5-5... and so on.

Once you connect the computer with a device, you have to connect to the CLI like Putty
 - You turn on putty and change the session connection type into "Serial"
 - It should work fine with default settings
 - you can view and edit the default settings inside putty location "Connection > Serial" if needed.
