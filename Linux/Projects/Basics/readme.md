<h1>Projects</h1>

This is pretty basic commands that I am going over, I used to learn a bit of linux a while back and I thought, why not do a little recap ðŸ˜Š
Currently the source where I am going over to revise everything is on linuxjourney.com and everything that is listed here is something that I'm doing on my Ubuntu VM

 <h2>Commands</h2>
 
 - pwd = print out current directory
 - cd = change directory
     Extra commands
     - $ cd . = Current directory
     - $ cd .. = Takes you one directory backwards
     - $ cd ~ = Takes you to home directory such as /home/username
     - $ cd - = Takes you back to your previous directory  
 - ls = list directories and files in your current directory
     Extra commands
      - $ ls /home/username = You can look up directories and file by specifying the directories source
      - $ ls -a = shows all directories and files (and the hidden ones)
      - $ ls -l = shows a detailed list of the directories and files, information like, file permissions, number of links, owner name, owner group, file size, timestamp and last modification
      - $ ls -la = same way how -a and -l work but combined.
      - $ ls -R = Recursively lists directories contents
      - $ ls -r = reverse order while sorting
      - $ ls -t = sort by modification time, newest first
 - touch = Create a file
