This is pretty basic commands that I am going over, I used to learn a bit of linux a while back and I thought, why not do a little recap ðŸ˜Š
Currently the source where I am going over to revise everything is on linuxjourney.com

 <h2>Commands</h2>
 
 - pwd = print out current directory
 - cd = change directory
     Extra commands
     - $ cd . = Current directory
     - $ cd .. = Takes you one directory backwards
     - $ cd ~ = Takes you to home directory such as /home/username
     - $ cd - = Takes you back to your previous directory  
 - ls = list directories
