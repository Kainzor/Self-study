<h1>Welcome to my Terraform self-study repository!</h1>

Everything you find in here is a test project that I have been learning by my self and have finished with. There's more to come and many things to test out!
I will also be updating this readme file everytime I try out something and make a small document about my "todays" work and so on.

<h3>#2 Virtual network</h3>
Today I've come across some minor problems with terraform that I didn't understand, I looked through the problems and within couple of minutes I was able to find it and it turns out... it was a newbie mistake haha!

But today I was working on creating virtual network with subnet and a security group with rules that comes with it. There's no set and stone what I wanted to edit into the security group since I am not really working on a VM or a company's environment but I think it's a great achievement to have accomplished this for todays work. I did find out some minor typo's but with the help of terraforms documentation I was able to solve the problem. Can't wait to find something more to try out!

I've also learned new commands with powershell while I've been working on this project which have helped me out. Switching terraform into tf via alias was a life saver!

<h3>#1 First time!</h3>
Technically I used up 2 days not gonna lie because there was a lot to learn on the first day learning terraform. I've got used to the commands and I've also learned a bit more regarding github.

Today I learned how to create a resource group through terraform and it's amazing! I've not tried ARM yet with azure but I really enjoy playing around with terraform and I will keep on learning further on next day.
