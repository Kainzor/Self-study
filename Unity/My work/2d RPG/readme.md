<h1>My 2d RPG</h1>

Here I am going to make a game that is a RPG like 2d game, I'm not planning to make it a long one it's more of a personal project that I want to try out for my self and discover how to create a RPG-like game.

I will be posting a update post here and a seperate section of all my C# code and gamefiles that I use for the game.

But before then, I have to create my own pixel sprites for my game. As I am more of a coder than a art designer, it's gona take me a while to finish the character.

<h1>Update 1: The first player!</h1>

If I'm going to make a game, the player has to play a character ofcourse, meet a sprite that I drew my self, that took a bit of a while to do!

I've been practicing using aseprite and create my own character, this is ofc not super original since I tried to find some knight sprite on the internet and then I added this "Dark knight" theme with horns and stuff, I like it so I will keep this for now (maybe update it later when I feel like it)

As u see underneath the picture, I created a idle animation that I learned on the way, it's not insanely detailed but I think it looks good enough, again... I am not much of making arts my self hehe.

<h2>Controls</h2>

Now that we created a character with a idle animation, I want to try it out.

And it works! (Can't seem to make the Gif repeat on github, will check later)

Now here I am setting up the input actions using the input action editor, apparently there was a older one that is being depricated so I am trying out this new version, it looks simple and I assume that it will be a lot easier to code with.

So I have gone over doing a lot of stuff trying to understand how they interact and understand the coding.
I begun by doing the settings to create inputs on the input manager
After that I did some research on coding how to connect them 2 together which is here

They have made it a fairly simplified coding needed from what I have previously seen in the past and I see why this is going to take over the old input manager.

But after that I saved and connected the script to the player object and a new component(new for me) called "Player input". Supposedly supose to be a ease way of connecting the input to the player object. 

And Wollahh!

Not quite you were expecting right? I think it's cool seeing my Dark knight moonwalk like that hehe, but there's work to be done. It's pretty late now so I am going to call it for  today, next time I will be focusing on walking animations for my character. I am not going to go very in detail with art style related stuff and put most of my time on art, but I will try to make it as nice as possible.
