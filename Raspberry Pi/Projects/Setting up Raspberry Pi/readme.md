<h1>Setting up Raspberry Pi</h1>
 
Here we start off by doing a command line
```sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y```
What it does is that it refreshes the local package index with information about the lates versions of software available, and by using sudo apt dist-upgrade -y it will update and remove that isn't needed anymore. This should be done everytime you get a fresh Raspberry or need to update it.
